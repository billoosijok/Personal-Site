I am Belal Sejouk, a web and mobile developer. I've discovered my passion for programming
when I had the chance to take an introductory class in 2015 at Clark College. In addition
to programming classes, I started learning more about developing for the web and for iOS from
online resources. Fast-forward 2 years later, I was lucky to win Apple's WWDC17 and receive
OSWALD awards from Clark College's web development program.

It all started in my hometown Tripoli in Libya. In 2013, My family had bought an iPod Touch that we all shared.
I was fascinated by the design and attention to detail that I never saw in other products. That gave me
an idea of being the person who can make a machine do such things and look like that. However, I didn't
have an idea of how I could become that person.

In 2014, I was chosen to be one of 8 finalists in Libya to study abroad in the U.S. Coming to the U.S. for the
first time was a dramatic cultural change, but fun, nonetheless. I was lucky to have been placed with a very
generous American host family. By the end of my exchange year, they offered me to stay in the U.S. instead of
going back to Libya, since downfall that Libya has been going through.

After the change of my plans for going back to my country, I found myself reconnecting with my older passion.
    So I decided to enroll into an introductory class for programming. That's when I saw the light bulb.
    I decided that this will be my focus and build up to my dream for creating iOS-like user experiences with
    software.

    I started learning web development and using that knowledge to learn iOS development. I learned about Apple's
    WWDC scholarship and was very motivated to create an app to apply. After a year of learning the Swift
    programming language and the development patterns of iOS, I applied to the WWDC scholarship with my first
    complete iOS application. I was lucky enough to have been chosen to be one of 350 students who won the scholarship.

<p class="item enterFromBottom">
    Then I received 2 OSWALD awards from Clark College. An award given to students for their academic and work acheivements.
    I received one from my Clark College's work supervisor, and one from the Web Development department.
</p>

<p class="item enterFromBottom">
    Now, I am about to graduate Clark College with a Web Development degree. I am grateful for all the people who have helped me get to this point,
    especially my host family.
