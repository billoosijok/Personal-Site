I am Belal Sejouk, a web developer. I've discovered my passion for programming
when I had the chance to take an introductory class in 2015 at Clark College. In addition
to programming classes, I started learning more about developing for the web and for iOS from
online resources. Fast-forward 2 years later, I was lucky to win Apple's WWDC17 and receive
OSWALD awards from Clark College's web development program.

    When I decided to enroll into an introductory class for programming, I saw the light bulb.
    I decided that this will be my focus and build up to my dream for creating engaging and interactive user experiences with
    software.

    I started learning web development and using that knowledge to learn iOS development. I learned about Apple's
    WWDC scholarship and was very motivated to create an app to apply. After a year of learning the Swift
    programming language and the development patterns of iOS, I applied to the WWDC scholarship with my first
    complete iOS application. I was lucky enough to have been chosen in such a worldwide contest.

    Soon after, I received 2 OSWALD awards from Clark College. An award given to students for their academic and work acheivements.
    I received one from my Clark College's work supervisor, and one from the Web Development department.

    Now, I am about to graduate Clark College with a Web Development degree. I am grateful for all the people who have helped me get to this point,
    especially my host family.
